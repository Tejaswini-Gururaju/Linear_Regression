# Linear_Regression

This is a sales dataset in summer to predict the sales revenue after selling the ice-creams.

Here we have plotted a simple scatter plot to find the linear relationship between our independent and dependent feature.

After finding the relationship we have deployed a Linear Regression model on the dataset and trained on model.

As expected the model was giving a good predicted results.
